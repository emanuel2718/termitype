## Development

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/emanuel2718/termitype.git
cd termitype
```

2. Build and run:
```sh
# Normal run
cargo run

# Debug mode
cargo run -- --debug
```

3. Optional: Install theme Pack
```sh
# Download the theme pack
wget -qO- https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/archive/0e23daf59234fc892cba949562d7bf69204594bb.tar.gz | tar -xvzf -

# Move the themes to the assets folder
mv iTerm2-Color-Schemes-0e23daf59234fc892cba949562d7bf69204594bb/ghostty/* assets/themes/ && rm -rf iTerm2-Color-Schemes-0e23daf59234fc892cba949562d7bf69204594bb/
```

- NOTE: The build process will automatically download and embed the theme pack during the first build. The themes are stored in `assets/themes` and will be included in the final release binary.

## Installation

```sh
cargo install termitype@0.0.1-alpha.1
```

### TODO

- [ ] Proper Results screen
- [ ] User defined config in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/termitype/config`. Takes precedence over default config and persitent config state in db
- [ ] Settings persistance
- [ ] Results (locally) tracking with sqlite (can be opted-out with `termitype --no-track`)
- [ ] Add click actions everywhere it makes sense
- [ ] Improve the Footer with icons if possible
- [ ] Use [tui-big-text](https://docs.rs/tui-big-text/latest/tui_big_text/) for the title
- [ ] Layout cleanup pass
- [ ] Performance optimization pass before release (cargo flamegraph --root)
- [ ] Add LICENSE
- [ ] Release on crates.io, Homebrew, AUR, nixpkgs, etc

### Done
- [x] Build Github CI
- [x] Theme swap at runtime (Menu -> Themes -> <list of themes>)
- [x] Theme preview in menu
- [x] Change cursor style via cli
- [x] Change cursor style at runtime
- [x] Only show (3) lines with scroll off
- [x] underline wrong words (must have at least one wrong character for it to be underlined)
- [x] Add scrolbar to the menu
- [x] Preview the cusror style change like we do with the theme picker
- [x] Change language at runtime
- [x] Add more languages and word lists (good enough for now)
- [x] Change mode/value with the menu
- [x] Fetch themes at build time from [iterm2Themes url](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/archive/0e23daf59234fc892cba949562d7bf69204594bb.tar.gz)
- [x] Don't include `debug` flag in release
