# Termitype


### TODO

- [ ] tracker for all the metrics
  - wpm (normal/raw)
  - accuracy
  - consistency
  - time tracking
  - wrong/correct chars/words
  - wrong/total keystrokes
- [ ] toggle mode/punctuation/numbers/symbols at runtime
- [ ] menu
- [ ] themes
  - [ ] `termitype --list-themes`
  - [ ]`termitype --theme tokyonight`
  - [ ] custom themes in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/termitype/theme/<custom-theme>`
  - [ ] swap themes at runtime (Menu -> Themes -> <list of themes>) with preview
  - [ ] use iterm/ghostty color pattern ?
  - [ ] fetch themes at build time from https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes




- [ ] implement word pool generator using languages as json files

### Notes
- think about using json for the languages like monkeytype does [monkeytype _list.json](https://github.com/monkeytypegame/monkeytype/blob/bb3a99861fe96a7ecf4a31758f87c3b8057c6e29/frontend/static/languages/_list.json)
