## Development

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/emanuel2718/termitype.git
cd termitype
```

2. Optional: Install theme Pack
```sh
# NOTE: This is only required for local development. In production, this is handled automatically by the build process.
./scripts/install-themes.sh
```

3. Build and run:
```sh
# Normal run
cargo run

# Debug mode
cargo run -- --debug
```



## Installation

```sh
cargo install termitype@0.0.1-alpha.18
```
