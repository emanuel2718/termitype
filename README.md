- [ ] Fetch themes at build time from [iterm2Themes url](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/archive/0e23daf59234fc892cba949562d7bf69204594bb.tar.gz)
- [ ] Performance optimization pass before release (cargo flamegraph --root)
    - want to improve the word tracking `Word { start: usize, end: usize, text: String }` or something like that
        - might be heavy on the memory tho

- [x] Theme swap at runtime (Menu -> Themes -> <list of themes>)
- [x] Theme preview in menu
- [x] Change cursor style via cli
- [x] Change cursor style at runtime
- [x] Only show (3) lines with scroll off
